This involved utilizing full stack development skills, managing complex data flows through various layers between a responsive web application frontend built with Typescript and Angular and a mongoDB database while remaining conscious of security, network efficiency and internal company coding guidelines.\nThis project was also an excellent experience in working within Agile development strategies, facilitating open communication and tracking of progress within the team through regular standup meetings and the use of JIRA for task breakdown and arisen issues, and maintaining a high quality deliverable product with a DevOps system of code reviews through version control systems and automated testing and analysis pipelines to pass before publishing.\nThrough these strategies, I was able to create robust new options for user permission control through assigning groups of users and devices within Vista Manager that met the needs of the project while enhancing my full stack development skillset and consciousness of good development practices.",

In cases where the reports' function had more severely degraded, I personally liaised with the relevant parties within other departments of the council to arrange and implement situationally appropriate solutions.\nFurthermore, once this project was completed, I undertook the additional task of creating a new reporting page for one such department utilizing Microsoft PowerBI. This involved working directly alongside a product client to identify and meet their specific needs and self-driven learning of new technology in order to deliver a satisfactory end product.",

Initially this was a position helping with community moderation and management, where I helped to foster a friendly and inclusive environment and grew my communication and mediation skills by working and interacting with a wide variety of people from around the world. I was also involved in the internal testing process of the game, operating in a high trust environment and working to identify and clearly communicate bugs to the developers through targeted playtesting. \nLater in the process, I proved my self-driven learning of the game’s internal Ruby codebase and was brought in to collaborate with the development team itself on the debugging process for the polishing phase of the public release. This involved working collaboratively with the team to identify and fix the underlying causes of bug submissions from community members. Together, we helped create a rich and polished game experience for the community.",
